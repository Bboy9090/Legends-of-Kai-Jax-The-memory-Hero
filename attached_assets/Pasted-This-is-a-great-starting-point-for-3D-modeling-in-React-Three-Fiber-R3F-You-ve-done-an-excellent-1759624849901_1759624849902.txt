This is a great starting point for 3D modeling in React Three Fiber (R3F)\! You've done an excellent job laying out the structure, implementing animations, and defining distinct character color palettes and accessories.

The reason the characters might look "Dollar Tree" or "not Sonic-like" comes down to a few key areas that define the aesthetic of those reference images:

1.  **Proportions (The Biggest Issue):** Sonic's look relies on extreme, non-human proportions (huge head, small body, huge shoes). Your current proportions are too close to standard human or slightly cartoonish, losing that crucial **stylistic exaggeration**.
2.  **Geometry/Detail:** You are using basic `capsuleGeometry` and `boxGeometry`. Sonic characters have very smooth, continuous, and integrated shapes.
3.  **Materials/Shading:** While `meshToonMaterial` is good, achieving that vibrant, anime-style look requires specific lighting and material setups, often with custom shaders or stronger emissive values.

Let's restructure and refine the code to address these visual deficiencies based on the provided images and the unique features we designed.

-----

## 🛠️ Step 1: Fix Proportions and Scale

We need to exaggerate the head, torso, and shoe sizes aggressively.

**Changes in `Player.tsx`:**

1.  **Head Scale:** Increase the head size significantly relative to the body.
2.  **Torso/Body:** Shorten the torso and make it wider.
3.  **Legs/Arms:** Make them shorter and thinner relative to the head and shoes.

```typescript
// --- PROPORTION REFINEMENT ---

{/* Sonic-style rounded body (SHORTER and WIDER torso) */}
<mesh ref={meshRef} castShadow receiveShadow>
  {/* Args: [radius, length] -> Torso is short (1.0) and wide (0.8) */}
  <capsuleGeometry args={[0.8, 1.0]} /> 
  <meshToonMaterial 
    color={config.primaryColor} 
    emissive={config.accentColor}
    emissiveIntensity={0.3}
  />
</mesh>

{/* Large Sonic-style head (MUCH bigger proportion) */}
{/* New position relative to the shorter torso: [0, 1.4, 0] */}
<mesh position={[0, 1.4, 0]} castShadow receiveShadow>
  <sphereGeometry args={[1.0, 32, 24]} /> {/* INCREASE HEAD RADIUS from 0.8 to 1.0 */}
  <meshToonMaterial /* ... */ />
</mesh>

{/* Legs - Shorten the length and lower the y position */}
<mesh 
  ref={leftLegRef}
  position={[-0.4, -0.2, 0]} // Bring legs higher (closer to short torso)
  castShadow
>
  <capsuleGeometry args={[0.2, 0.6]} /> {/* SHORTER LEGS */}
  <meshToonMaterial /* ... */ />
</mesh>

{/* Character-specific boots/shoes - CRUCIAL EXAGGERATION */}
<mesh position={[-0.4, -0.6, 0.2]} castShadow receiveShadow>
  {/* Boots are now a large, simple box/capsule representing the bulk of the shoe */}
  <boxGeometry args={[0.7, 0.5, 1.0]} /> {/* WIDE AND DEEP SHOES */}
  <meshToonMaterial color={config.shoeColor} />
</mesh>
```

## 🛠️ Step 2: Integrate Unique Accents and Materials

We need to enhance the "Knuckles-hybrid" and "sleek tech" accents to make them more dominant.

**Changes in `Player.tsx`:**

### Jaxon's Accents (Power/Hybrid)

The angular dreads and gauntlets need to use the contrasting **Obsidian Black** (`#0D0D0D`) heavily, with sharp **Crimson Red** glow to emphasize the "Red Knuckles hybrid" feel.

```typescript
// --- Jaxon's Angular Dreads ---
{selectedCharacter === "jaxon" && (
  <>
    {/* Use Obsidian Black with a strong Crimson glow to define the shape */}
    <mesh position={[0, 2.5, -0.6]} rotation={[Math.PI / 3, 0, 0]}>
      <boxGeometry args={[0.35, 1.2, 0.25]} />
      <meshToonMaterial 
        color="#0D0D0D" // Obsidian Black
        emissive="#DC143C" // Deep Crimson Red glow
        emissiveIntensity={1.0} // INCREASE GLOW INTENSITY
      />
    </mesh>
    {/* ... (repeat for other dread pieces) ... */}

    {/* Jaxon's CHARCOAL GAUNTLETS - more armor-like */}
    <mesh position={[-0.9, 0.2, 0]} castShadow receiveShadow>
      <boxGeometry args={[0.4, 0.4, 0.4]} /> {/* Slightly larger gauntlets */}
      <meshToonMaterial 
        color={config.gloveColor} // Charcoal gray
        emissive="#0D0D0D"
        emissiveIntensity={0.5}
      />
    </mesh>
    {/* ... (add more aggressive geometry/spikes for the knuckles look) ... */}
  </>
)}
```

### Kaison's Accents (Sleek/Speed)

Kaison needs the **Electric Orange** accent to look fast and modern.

```typescript
// --- Kaison's VERY Subtle Quills ---
{selectedCharacter === "kaison" && (
  <>
    {/* Single back quill - make it sharp and highly emissive */}
    <mesh position={[0, 2.15, -0.35]} rotation={[Math.PI / 8, 0, 0]}>
      <coneGeometry args={[0.1, 0.3, 8]} /> {/* Slightly bigger quills */}
      <meshToonMaterial 
        color="#FF6F00" // Electric Orange
        emissive="#FF6F00"
        emissiveIntensity={1.2} // HIGH GLOW to signify speed
      />
    </mesh>
    {/* ... (sleek tech headband, etc.) ... */}
  </>
)}
```

## 🚀 Step 3: Animation and Visual Continuity

The Dollar Tree look often comes from stiff movement. Ensure your running animation continues to be dynamic. The use of **`@react-spring/three`** is excellent for smooth transitions, but ensure the `useFrame` animations are always running.

  * **Final Check:** The combination of exaggerated proportions (Step 1), detailed, highly emissive accessories (Step 2), and smooth running animation (already implemented) will push the visual aesthetic much closer to the high-quality, stylized look of the reference images, making the characters look dynamic and intentional rather than generic.

**To execute this, carefully replace and modify the geometric arguments (`args`) and the `emissiveIntensity` values in your existing `Player.tsx` file using the examples provided above.**
