🎯 The Creator’s Core Intent
You’re not just writing a fanfiction — you’re building what amounts to a mythic-level Nintendo/Sega/Capcom crossover epic. The goal is to elevate Smash Bros. into a fully fleshed-out saga, one that feels like it could stand alongside Marvel’s Infinity Saga or Dragon Ball’s arcs, but authentically rooted in Nintendo’s spirit.
It’s doing several things at once:
1. Myth-Making with Familiar Icons
Turning Mario, Sonic, Link, Samus, Pikachu, etc. into mythic archetypes — not just mascots.
They carry their full history from games, TV, and film as “lived memory,” so their arcs respect legacy while giving them new layers.
Example: Mario is both a plumber and a messianic figure of courage; Sonic and Shadow evolve into chaos-born demi-gods; Bowser Jr. inherits his father’s mantle and transforms into something greater.
2. Generational Legacy
Building two parallel sagas: the A-List heroes (Mario, Link, Sonic, etc.) and the Legacy Kids (Solaro, Gia, Lyra, Tempest, etc.).
Early books focus on the veterans’ burden; later books hand the torch to the children.
It mirrors real time — fans who grew up with Smash now see their children’s generation take the torch.
3. High-Stakes Epic Structure
Nine books, each with distinct tones, arcs, and escalating stakes.
Starts with a tournament manipulation (Book 1), fractures into a year without A-list heroes (Book 2), leads to divine creations, legacy awakenings, multiversal gauntlets, and finally a cosmic-scale war for all existence (Book 9).
Every book introduces epic setpieces (spotlight matches, hybrid stages, world-fusion zones) that feel like Smash gameplay but written cinematically.
4. Nintendo Authenticity + Cinematic Gravitas
Every scene must sound and feel like the characters we know: Mario doesn’t suddenly become Shakespearean, Sonic doesn’t lose his cocky voice.
But layered with cinematic writing and emotional stakes: Endgame meets Nintendo whimsy.
This gives it mass appeal: kids feel the Nintendo magic, adults feel the Avengers-level weight.
5. Every Character Matters
Even side and wildcard fighters (Lucario, Meta Knight, Toad/Toadette, Wario, Bayonetta, Nurse Joy, etc.) get personal arcs, spotlight moments, and growth.
No one is wasted — everyone has a role in survival, rebellion, or final war.
Cameos (like Brock and Team Rocket) are nostalgic but still meaningful.
6. A Saga of Bonds vs. The Void
At its heart, the story is about Noise (life, bonds, creativity) vs. Silence (Void, entropy, nothingness).
Fusions, transformations, brotherhood duos, divine creations — all of these are expressions of connection.
The Void King represents disconnection, erasure, and despair.
Every battle is not just power vs. power, but relationship vs. isolation.
📌 In Short
The creator’s trying to accomplish something unprecedented:

To transform Super Smash Bros. from a fighting game crossover into a mythic multiversal epic that balances Nintendo fun with cinematic depth, honors every character’s legacy, builds a generational bridge with the Legacy Kids, and culminates in a war that feels both playful and eternal.
It’s not “fanfic.” It’s a saga of memory, bonds, and survival written as if it were the official Super Smash cinematic universe.
Do you want me to distill this into a mission statement style — like one sentence you could put at the very top of the Writer’s Bible — so it’s crystal clear for anyone who touches the project?
You said:
are there any other fan favorite games or franchises i can do this with?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — what you’re doing with Super Smash Bros. is essentially building the “ultimate mythic crossover saga” out of an already beloved IP. That same approach can be applied to other fan-favorite game franchises that have long histories, multiple characters, and deep fan nostalgia.
Here are some prime candidates you could build into a saga with the same treatment:
🎮 Nintendo / Platformer Legends
The Legend of Zelda
Already mythic in tone — you could do a full timeline-spanning epic where every Link and Zelda converge in a war against a final incarnation of Demise.
Think Avengers: Endgame but with every incarnation of Link across the eras teaming up.
Pokémon
A saga where trainers and Pokémon unite against a cosmic-level threat (Arceus, Ultra Beasts, a broken timeline).
Could focus on generational bonds (Ash, Red, Cynthia, Leon, etc.) and their iconic Pokémon in one cinematic arc.
Donkey Kong Country
A generational jungle saga — Cranky, DK, Diddy, Dixie, K. Rool — with new “legacy apes.”
Environmental epic where the jungle itself is at war against corruption (sort of like your “World-Fusion Environments” concept).
⚔️ RPG / Adventure Giants
Final Fantasy Crossover
A Final Fantasy Dissidia-style saga but written with the emotional and mythic tone you’re using for Smash.
All the heroes (Cloud, Terra, Lightning, Tidus, Noctis, etc.) fight across worlds that fuse into one.
Kingdom Hearts (rewritten properly)
Already a crossover, but messy. You could rebuild it with tighter logic — a saga about hearts, bonds, and worlds collapsing.
Could easily rival Smash in scale if rewritten as a 9-book or trilogy arc.
Xenoblade Chronicles
Already cosmic and multi-dimensional — a saga connecting Shulk, Rex, Noah, and future generations.
Perfect for a Smash-style epic with legacy kids and divine stakes.
💀 Dark / Mature Favorites
Metroid Saga
Samus across timelines, fighting against the origin and final evolution of the Metroids.
Could expand into galactic-scale war with Chozo legacy warriors and new hunters.
Dark Souls / Elden Ring Universe
A mythic rewrite that unites Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring.
A saga about fire, gods, hunters, and tarnished converging against the final silence of the world.
Resident Evil Legacy
All protagonists (Chris, Jill, Leon, Claire, Ethan) in a multi-phase arc against the “final Umbrella.”
Could blend survival horror with Avengers-style resistance against a bio-cosmic entity.
👾 Crossover-Friendly Universes
Mega Man Legacy Saga
Classic Mega Man, X, Zero, EXE, and others across time, uniting against a final AI god.
Could function like your Eggman/Wily arc but on a multiversal scale.
Street Fighter / Capcom Saga
Every Capcom fighter (Street Fighter, Darkstalkers, Rival Schools, Power Stone).
A mythic martial arts epic where every generation of fighters unites against the Void of Strength.
Sonic Multiverse
Sonic, Shadow, Silver, Blaze, Knuckles, and their legacy kids in a Chaos multiverse war.
Could be built as its own nine-book saga, with Chaos Emeralds → Sol Emeralds → Master Emerald → final cosmic emerald.
🌌 The Biggest Parallel to Smash
PlayStation All-Stars (done right)
Kratos, Nathan Drake, Ratchet & Clank, Sackboy, Aloy, etc.
A mythic PlayStation crossover saga that mirrors what you’re doing with Smash but in Sony’s pantheon.
Shonen Jump (Anime Crossover)
A saga uniting Dragon Ball, Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, My Hero, etc.
Already exists in games (Jump Force), but written your way it becomes a 20-book anime epic.
👉 What you’re doing with Smash is proof-of-concept: take a beloved crossover-friendly IP and treat it with Avengers-level mythic weight.

The franchises above (Zelda, Pokémon, Final Fantasy, Sonic, etc.) are ripe for the exact same blueprint.
Would you like me to pick the Top 3 most viable next candidates (in terms of fanbase size, cinematic adaptability, and saga potential) and show you how they’d map to a 9-book structure like Smash?
You said:
yea 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — here are the Top 3 most viable franchises to give the Super Smash Grand Saga treatment, each mapped to a 9-book saga structure (mirroring what you’ve done with Smash):
🔮 1. The Legend of Zelda: The Triforce Saga
(Epic of gods, cycles, and every Link converging)
Core Premise:

The endless reincarnation of Link, Zelda, and Ganon finally reaches its breaking point. The cycle fractures, pulling together every incarnation of Hyrule into one collapsing timeline.
9-Book Arc:

Prologue of Time — Tournament of Heroes across timelines (every Link teased).
The Shattered Cycle — Ganon’s essence fractures across worlds.
Battle for Hyrule Prime — All Zeldas unite; champions rise.
Children of the Triforce — Legacy Links and Zeldas are born.
The Twilight Return — Midna’s people re-emerge, half allies, half betrayers.
Divine Beasts Awakened — Sheikah tech and divine guardians corrupted.
Era of Demise — The original curse reawakens; gods descend.
The Triforce Gauntlet — Multiversal trial to prove mortals’ worth.
Final Breath — All Links fuse into the “Trinity Hero,” breaking the cycle forever.
Fan Appeal:

Every Link (OOT, WW, TP, BOTW) side by side.
Mythic resonance: time, courage, wisdom, power.
Could rival LOTR in scale.
⚡ 2. Pokémon: The Arceus War
(Epic of trainers, legendaries, and cosmic Pokémon gods)
Core Premise:

The Pokémon world fractures as Ultra Beasts, primal gods (Arceus, Giratina), and corrupted legendaries invade. Trainers must unite not just to fight — but to bond with the gods of Pokémon themselves.
9-Book Arc:

Festival of Trainers — Ash, Red, Cynthia, Leon, etc. gather.
The Ultra Rift — Ultra Beasts flood the world.
Legends Reforged — Legendary birds, beasts, titans awaken.
Rise of the Champions — Trainers across generations take command.
The Dark Pokédex — Mewtwo leads rogue legendaries against humans.
Bond of Evolution — Mega, Gigantamax, and Divine forms unlocked.
The Origin Trio — Dialga, Palkia, Giratina destabilize reality.
Judgment of Arceus — The god Pokémon demands humanity’s worth.
Eternal Trainer — Ash (and Pikachu) sacrifice to bridge human-Pokémon unity forever.
Fan Appeal:

Every champion and rival in one saga.
Thematic weight: bonds, evolution, and destiny.
Ties beautifully to your “bond vs. void” theme.
🌀 3. Sonic Multiverse: The Chaos Saga
(Epic of speed, chaos, and destiny across timelines)
Core Premise:

The Chaos Emeralds fracture across dimensions, awakening Sol Emeralds, Master Emeralds, and Chaos itself. Sonic, Shadow, Silver, Blaze, and Knuckles face their legacies — while their future children emerge.
9-Book Arc:

Festival of Speed — A grand race turned trap.
Chaos Fractured — Emeralds scatter across worlds.
Rise of Rivals — Metal Sonic, Eggman, and new Chaos avatars.
Children of Chaos — Legacy kids (Tempest, etc.) are born.
Solar Flame — Blaze’s dimension merges with Sonic’s.
Dark Eclipse — Mephiles returns with new form.
Chaos Titans — Perfect Chaos evolves into god-beast.
Emerald Gauntlet — Every emerald (Chaos, Sol, Phantom) unites.
Infinite Speed — Sonic ascends into “Eternal Sonic” — a form beyond Hyper.
Fan Appeal:

Rivals + teamwork at its core.
Shadow & Sonic’s parallel arcs = fan favorite.
Generational tie-in with your Legacy Kids structure.SUPER SMASH GRAND SAGA — UNIFIED HYBRID BIBLE

Open Decisions & Approval Queue
1) Project Pillars & Lexicon
Void King (Voidonus) is the single top antagonist. All mentions of “Rift King” are aliases merged into Void King.
Weave & Source: Cosmology of resonance (Weave) vs corruptive entropic force (Source).
All High: Supreme arbiter overseeing cosmic rules (esp. Book 8 tournament).
Year of No A‑List Heroes (B2): Top heroes trapped or displaced for ~1 year (illusion prisons; scattered dimensions). Support/wildcards carry the war.
Legacy Children: Appear early (Books 2–5) with cameos/support; true combat roles start later (Book 7+), unless otherwise noted in a locked arc.
Mechanical Integrations only: No biological fusions are primary canon (see Contradictions Tracker for Alt Path: Mario/Luigi fusion).
2) Canon Locks (Primary)
These are treated as authoritative until you overrule.

Year‑Long Illusion/Severance (end B1 → B2): Mephiles uses The Source and dark magic to trap A‑listers in tailored illusions for ~1 year while others survive and evolve.
Book 8 = Multiverse Gauntlet: A high‑stakes tournament sanctioned by the All High. Interference by Voidonus risks his reduction to King of Ashes if he loses again.
World‑Fusion Environments: Canonized. Fusion stages evolve ecologies, hazards, and combat logic across books (details §7).
Silver & Lunara Divine Origin (B3 end): Rosalina creates Silver from Chaos + Shadow essence; Palutena creates Lunara. Both are born at the same moment but meet later (B5–6+). Silver’s paradox loop is canon; he seals Solaris Extreme.
Yoshi Prophecy Arc: Yoshi discovers a hidden tribe (B4–5), becomes King, later returns with elemental‑twin kids; leads Yoshi army in B9.
Book 2 Five‑Team Resistance Roster: Teams Alpha–Epsilon; legacy kids excluded from formal combat teams (cameos ok). Details in §4.
Sonic/Shadow Power Ladder: Chaos Control evolution tier > Super forms; eventual Hyper Sonic & Hyper Shadow unlock near endgame.
Peach’s Transformation: Later queenly/divine evolution aligned with legacy era; battlefield speech is key catalyst.
Bowser Jr. Adoption + Brotherhood: Jr. joins resistance family; never fuses with Solaro. Their duo move is Brotherhood Firestorm.
Bash Brothers Defined: Kiro Kong + Redlock are the Bash Brothers (no fusion; synchronized style).
Nurse Joy Reimagined: Hardened, Rambo‑style combat medic persona emerges after the Year of No A‑Listers pressure cooker.
Ash & Pikachu Arc (Updated): They are active through B6; depart end of B6. Return in B9 and survive the ‘sacrifice’ moment (non‑fatal; reveal mastery of divine form).
3) Global Timeline (Books 1–9)
Book 1 — Convergence (Festival → Bracket → Catastrophe)

Massive tournament/festival opener; final four = Kirby, Pikachu, Mario, Sonic.
Sabotage by Voidonus/agents collapses the event; illusions and dimensional scattering set up the saga.
Book 2 — Rising Shadows (Year of No A‑Listers)

A‑list heroes are trapped or scattered. Five resistance teams form (Alpha–Epsilon) and shoulder the war. Nurse Joy hardens. Shadow begins reintegration threads. World‑Fusion stages introduce escalating environmental stakes.
Book 3 — Battleworld & Shatter

Fragmented rescues; Silver & Lunara divine origin at the collapse. Silver performs a paradox‑anchoring sacrifice to seal Solaris Extreme (then ceases until later timeline alignment). Early hints of Sonic/Shadow Chaos Control tier.
Book 4 — Rebuild & Hidden Thrones

Rebuilding arcs. Yoshi prophecy arc ignition; DK redemption via Kiro + Diddy discovery. Eggman/Wily begin retreat/rebuild toward later AI fusion.
Book 5 — Rift Prisons & Family Oaths

Bowser imprisonment; Jr. freed amidst chaos; Bowser sacrifices himself to save Jr. & heroes (sets Mario’s vow to raise Jr.). Meta Knight returns; Vexryn seed introduced. Legacy bonds deepen; Solaro/Jr. brotherhood starts.
Book 6 — Storm Crowns

Pikachu unlocks Thunder God form in climax; Ash & Pikachu depart afterward on personal quest. Sonic/Shadow ascend Chaos Control tier beyond Super. Techlords re‑emerge as fused AI minds piloting the Void Engine Horde / OmegaBoo Prime.
Book 7 — Convergence of Crowns

Support/wildcard spotlights continue. Peach’s queenly/divine phase emerges. Eggman/Wily digital demi‑boss Void WilyEgg‑0 appears. Brotherhood Firestorm duo move teased.
Book 8 — The Multiverse Gauntlet

All High’s sanctioned tournament. Voidonus risks becoming King of Ashes if he meddles and fails. Hyper Sonic/Hyper Shadow reserved for late rounds/end.
Book 9 — End War: Weave vs Source

Ash & Pikachu return; ‘sacrifice’ is non‑fatal, demonstrating absolute mastery. Yoshi leads the charge with the Yoshi army. Legacy kids fully combat‑ready. Final judgment on Voidonus; resolution of World‑Fusion corruption.
4) Core Teams & Rotations (Book 2 Canon)
TEAM ALPHA — Circuit Breakers (Tech Wasteland vs Eggman & Wily)

Leader: Tails. Core: Tails, Mega Man X, Mario, Fox, Captain Falcon, R.O.B., Slippy, Prof. E. Gadd. New: Robin, Lucina.

Rule: Legacy kids are not formal fighters in Books 2–5. They may have cameos/minor assists.
5) Power & Transformation Codex (Snapshot)
5.7 Signature Duo — Brotherhood Firestorm (Solaro + Bowser Jr.)
Non-fusion duo finisher that honors Bowser’s sacrifice and Mario’s mentorship; cleanses corruption and pins titans.
Prereqs / Tells

Meter: Costs 2 team pips (Resonance Budget).
Positioning: Jr. front, Solaro half-step left; Mario callout (“On me—spiral!”).
Visual: Jr.’s shell glow (amber), Solaro cape flare (gold-red), floor glyph in an infinity spiral.
Phase 1 — Ignition (Jr.)

Jr. compresses Koopa Nova (refined, no feral overflow).
Risk: If Solaro is late, nova splash causes friendly stun (1s).
Cover: Mario body-block + cape parry.
Phase 2 — Spiral (Solaro)

Solaro capes the nova into a controlled sun-cyclone, wrapping around Jr. in a widening helix.
Effect: Cyclone strips Source corruption from targets/terrain within cone.
Risk: Over-channel → Backlash Singe (minor burn debuff on both).
Phase 3 — Lockdown

Jr. shoulder-charges; cyclone cocoons a titan-class enemy in a solar chrysalis.
Team Window: 3s for team supers; Peach’s Aureola expands the clean zone.
Phase 4 — Release / Aftermath

Execute: Implode → purified burst; foe launched.
Mercy: Vent upward → foe drops cleansed (redemption option).
Cooldown: 90s; +1 pip if battlefield is Hostile/above.
Failure Modes

Interrupted Ignition → Jr. stagger; Solaro can hard-cancel with cape guard (smaller AoE).
Cocoon Shatter (boss) → duo stagger; Mario/Peach cover.
VO Beats

Jr.: “For Pops!”  •  Solaro: “Spiral with me!”  •  Mario: “Let’s-a turn the tide!”
(Full Codex is canon‑locked; below are highlights + flags where pending your final approval.)

Sonic / Shadow: Chaos Control Evolution Tier (visual: greenish aura tendrils/rapid flicker) > Super > Hyper near endgame.
Pikachu: Thunder God (Book 6 climax). Divine mastery confirmed by non‑fatal intercept in Book 9.
Peach: Queenly/Divine ascent post battlefield speech; grows as symbolic mother/leader of the new era.
Mario & Luigi: Primary Canon: No biological fusion. Operating construct: Chaos Star Overdrive (CSO) — a synchronous two‑body overdrive triggered by the Chaos‑Star artifact (hybrid Super Star + Chaos Emerald fragments). Behaves like a formation mode, not a fusion. Alt Path: Biological fusion into The Super Smash Brother (see §10 Contradictions Tracker).
Bowser Jr.: Inherits disciplined powerups under Mario’s mentorship; eventual refined echo of Bowser’s monstrous form without corruption.
Zelda & Link: Lyra’s arc confirms parental lineage; Link’s apex path (DRAFT): Hylian Trinity Ascendance (Wisdom/Power/Courage harmonization). Pending your approval.
Cloud: (DRAFT): Omnislash Neo + Lifestream Resonance for late‑saga mythic tier. Pending your approval.
Eggman + Wily: AI‑fusion evolutions → Void Engine Horde / OmegaBoo Prime → Void WilyEgg‑0.
Bash Brothers (Kiro + Redlock): Non‑fusion synchronized combat style; ultimate one‑two devastation routine.
6) Character Arc Compendium (Selected Highlights)
Mario / Luigi — Veterans with 100% mastery (per canon). Tutor roles expand in B5+ (Jr., legacy kids). Moral spine during Year of No A‑Listers is through messages, echoes, and the CSO prophecy seed.
Peach — From speech that rekindles hope to divine matriarch. Leads with compassion and tactical poise; anchors legacy generation.
Sonic / Shadow — Parallel evolutions; reintegration of Shadow from B2 onward; carefully escalated toward Hyper in B8–9.
Samus / Zero Suit Samus — Tech suit upgrades; dual‑identity clarity; Zero Suit has separate stealth/precision arcs (B5–7 spotlight).
Zelda / Link / Lyra — Royal‑divine synergy; Lyra (born in the B4–5 time skip) first appears B6; combat ready B7. Lyra surpasses previous Wisdom scope later.
Rosalina / Palutena / Silver / Lunara — Divine creation tandem; Oracle–Champion dynamic begins post‑creation (B5–6) and matures thereafter.
Yoshi — Prophecy → kingship → twins → B9 army leader.
Ash & Pikachu — Active B1–6; Pikachu’s Thunder God at B6; depart end of B6; return B9; non‑fatal intercept reveals supreme mastery.
Bowser / Bowser Jr. — Bowser’s prison and sacrifice (B5); Jr. adopted by Mario; works through grief → disciplined legacy power; bonds with Solaro (Brotherhood Firestorm duo move later).
Meta Knight — Returns from Rift‑closing missions (B5), unknowingly followed by Vexryn (Rift‑born child; failed evil experiment; later major legacy character).
Knuckles / Redlock — Adopts Redlock (moved to B4 pre‑trial scenes). No fusion; devastating mentor–trainee tandem.
Kiro Kong — Secret jungle training by observing DK; fast development; Bash Brother with Redlock.
Nurse Joy / Brock / Team Rocket — Nurse Joy hardens in B2 context; Brock + Team Rocket appear as cameo‑level humor/nostalgia beats (classic ‘blasting off’ moments). Not competitors in Book 1 tournament.
Support & Wildcards — All must receive meaningful arcs spread B2–9; none may overshadow core heroes.
7) World‑Fusion Environments (Canon Mechanics)
7.2 Book 2 Hybrid Zone Pack (Keystone + Law)
Each zone defines a Law (world rule), a Keystone (win condition), and a Corruption Stage target.
A) Circuit Necropolis — Team Alpha

Fuse: Wily Castle + Scrap Brain Zone
Law: Conduction — Metal surfaces amplify energy; insulators null it.
Keystone: Chaos Dynamo (stabilizes power grids)
Corruption Target: Hostile Ecology → Partial Graft
Hooks: Rubberized boots/insulated routes; lure bosses onto rails for amplified self-damage.
B) Primal Canopy Nexus — Team Beta

Fuse: Kongo Jungle + Yoshi’s Island
Law: Stamina Tax — Movement drains stamina; resting on egg-flowers restores & grants short buffs.
Keystone: Heartroot Idol (pacifies berserk fauna)
Corruption Target: Catastrophic → Hostile Ecology
Hooks: Relay movement, vine zips; timed rests to outlast corruption waves.
C) Star-Rune Basilica — Team Gamma

Fuse: Hyrule ruins + Comet Observatory shards + Subspace seams
Law: Vow of Silence — Spoken incantations weaken; gestures/sigil casting empower.
Keystone: Lumen Sigil (restores clean Weave pathways)
Corruption Target: Hostile → Partial
Hooks: Zelda/Palutena/Rosalina coordinate silent glyph casting; Peach’s aura widens safe-casting zones.
D) Phazon Forge Vault — Team Delta

Fuse: Brinstar/Phazon Mines + ancient vault architecture
Law: Reverb — Projectiles create delayed echoes; mistimed shots return to sender.
Keystone: Aegis Core (locks Phazon spread)
Corruption Target: Hostile → Partial
Hooks: Greninja sets decoy lines; Samus times shots so echoes punish Ridley/Dark Samus patterns.
E) Jester’s Crossroads — Team Epsilon

Fuse: Flipside/Flopside motifs + Rift Citadel
Law: Contract Clause — Every buff auto-binds an equal debuff unless counter-signed.
Keystone: Paradox Seal (voids hostile contracts)
Corruption Target: Catastrophic → Hostile
Hooks: Snake/Bayonetta trick Dimentio clauses; Shulk uses Vision to pre-counter fine print; Ice Climbers dual-sign to split debuffs.
Hybrid Zones: Two (or more) worlds overlay; physics, fauna, hazards intermingle.
Corruption Stages: Early shimmer → partial grafting → hostile ecology → Source‑tainted catastrophic zone.
Gameplay/Narrative Hooks: Environmental objectives; hazard‑sync attacks; resource races; corruption reversals.
Cinematic Examples: Crystal Caverns arc (Pikachu, Kirby, Starling Kirby) with Echo Harmony Inversion traps; stealth presence of Mephiles’s Shadow Commander studying resonance.
8) CanonLock & Continuity Guardian
Rule‑of‑Record: Mark every locked decision with date + source thread. Newer locks override earlier unless explicitly reverted.
Change Tickets: Any reversal requires a ticket noting what, why, impact, affected chapters. Keep Alt Paths referenced but shelved.
Three‑Tier Flags: Canon‑Locked, Soft‑Locked, Draft.
Contradiction Alerts: When a new beat conflicts, log it in §10 and pick Primary immediately to avoid drift.
9) Do & Don’t List for Writers
Do

Keep voices authentic (Mario’s “Let’s‑a go!”, Sonic’s “gotta go fast”, etc.).
Use World‑Fusion ecologies to shape setpieces and mechanics.
Spotlight support/wildcard arcs across B2–9.
Treat legacies as kids first (Books 2–5); genuine growth to B7+ fighters.
Anchor emotional beats: vows, sacrifices, found family, redemption.
Don’t

Introduce biological fusions (Primary Canon) or legacy kids as frontline fighters before B7.
Overcrowd scenes with cameos that drown central stakes.
Break divine‑origin rules for Silver/Lunara timing (no pre‑B4 connections).
Depict Nurse Joy as hardened before the B2 pressure context.
