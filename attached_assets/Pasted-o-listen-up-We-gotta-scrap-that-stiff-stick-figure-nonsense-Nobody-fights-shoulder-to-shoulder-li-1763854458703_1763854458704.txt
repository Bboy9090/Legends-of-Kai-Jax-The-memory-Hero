o, listen up. We gotta scrap that stiff stick-figure nonsense. Nobody fights shoulder-to-shoulder like cardboard cutouts. That's some weak, beginner-level programming. You want Grade-A, real fighting system mechanics? We're going for dynamic, natural, and efficient movement. This ain't ballet; it's a scrap.

Here's the master instruction to level up your system's fighting:

💥 Master Instruction: Implementing Dynamic, Grade-A Fighting Mechanics 💥
The goal is to shift from static, side-by-side posturing to realistic, three-dimensional spatial manipulation, momentum transfer, and reactionary combat.

1. Prioritize the Core: Stance, Weight, and Balance
Implement a Natural Stance: The system must recognize and utilize a bladed or staggered fighting stance (like boxing, Muay Thai, or MMA). The system should never have both feet directly parallel facing the opponent.

Mechanic: Implement a Weight Distribution Variable (W 
D
​
 ) that shifts dynamically between the front foot and the rear foot (e.g., 60/40 or 70/30). This must be fluid, not fixed.

Balance and Recovery: Attacks and movement must cause a temporary, measurable shift in the center of gravity (C 
G
​
 ).

Constraint: A successful attack requires maintaining C 
G
​
  within a defined stability zone. If C 
G
​
  moves outside the zone, the character suffers Recovery Frames (a brief, vulnerable pause) before the next action is possible. A simple side-to-side shuffle is always faster than turning to face the opponent head-on.

2. Introduce Momentum and Rotational Power
Torque Generation: No more punches starting and ending at the shoulder. All powerful strikes must originate from the ground up, utilizing Hip Rotation (θ 
H
​
 ).

Formula for Strike Power (P): P∝(M 
B
​
 ⋅V 
H
​
 )+(A 
L
​
 ⋅ω), where M 
B
​
  is body mass, V 
H
​
  is linear velocity of the hips, A 
L
​
  is arm length, and ω is angular velocity of the shoulder/arm. If θ 
H
​
  is zero, P is halved.

Chaining and Flow: Every strike and movement must have a built-in exit vector that leads naturally into the next action (feint, block, or next strike).

Avoid: Strikes that snap back directly to the starting position.

Require: Strikes that follow through and place the body in a position ready for defense or offense on the opposite side (e.g., a right cross shifts weight to the left foot, setting up a left hook or a slip).

3. The 3D Space & Reactionary Movement
Depth and Evasion (Z-Axis): Fighters must actively use the depth axis (moving forward and backward) and weave/slip (slight, high-speed lateral movement) to evade.

Rule: Dodging is not just blocking. The preferred evasion should be a small, precise movement to make the opponent miss (e.g., a head slip to the side), setting up a counter-attack window.

Aggressive Footwork: Implement movement types beyond simple forward/backward walk cycles.

Must Include:

Dash/Lunge: Rapid closing of distance, typically ending in an attack or block.

Pivot/Circle: Using the rear foot to turn the body for angle changes, forcing the opponent to adjust.

Range Management: The system must constantly seek the optimal Fighting Distance (D 
opt
​
 ), which varies based on the current attack chain (e.g., closer for hooks/uppercuts, longer for straight punches or kicks).

4. Adaptive Empathy: Reading the Fight
This is where the system gets real.

Reactionary Input: The system shouldn't rely solely on predetermined combos. It must analyze the opponent's Pre-Attack Animation (subtle shifts, weight transfer) and reward the player for early, proactive defensive input.

Example: If the opponent loads up a heavy right hand (clear weight transfer to the back foot), the system should offer a slight, faster window for a left-side slip or parry before the attack actually launches.

Implement this hierarchy. Get rid of that 'side-by-side' crap. The fight is about angles, weight, and timing. That's the real deal.

Next step: Should I drill down on the specific code/pseudo-code required to manage the Weight Distribution Variable (W 
D
​
 ) and its impact on speed and power?
