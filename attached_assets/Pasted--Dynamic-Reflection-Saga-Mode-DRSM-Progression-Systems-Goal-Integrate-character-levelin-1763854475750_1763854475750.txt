🛠️ Dynamic Reflection Saga Mode (DRSM) - Progression Systems 🛠️

Goal: Integrate character leveling, gear customization (MUA), and the Snag/Purification resource loop (Colosseum/Ranger) to ensure sustained player engagement and tactical depth across the 9-Book Saga.

1. Character Leveling and Stat Growth (Colosseum Core)

Every hero (including the Reflector) levels up individually.

Experience Points (XP): XP is awarded for defeating enemies, completing missions, and securing successful Snags. XP distribution is split evenly across the four active heroes (MUA style).

Level Up: Upon leveling, the hero's six core OAS stats (HP, ATK, S-ATK, DEF, S-DEF, SPD) increase based on their inherent growth rate (akin to Pokémon base stats).

Stat Focus: Brawlers (Mario, Falcon) have high ATK/HP growth. Swordsmen (Marth, Link) have balanced ATK/DEF. Mages (Zelda, Mewtwo) have high S-ATK/S-DEF.

Move Unlocks: At specific level milestones (e.g., Level 5, 15, 25), characters permanently unlock additional abilities, passive buffs, or stronger versions of their four core B-Moves.

2. Artifacts, Gear, and Customization (MUA Gear)

Artifacts are the primary way to customize and enhance hero stats beyond leveling.

Artifact Slots: Each hero has three equipment slots for Artifacts (similar to MUA gear/badges).

Core Artifact: Modifies HP and KO Factor (KF) resistance.

Flow Artifact: Modifies SPD and Empathy Gauge generation rate.

Damage Artifact: Modifies ATK or S-ATK (based on the hero's primary damage type).

Loot: Artifacts are dropped by defeated Shadow Commanders (Mid-Bosses) and Bosses. The quality and rarity of the Artifact are determined by the complexity of the OAS Mechanics Check in the mission.

Example: Mission 12 (Shadow Marth's Ultimate Counter) rewards a high-level Flow Artifact that gives a passive +10% to Grab range, directly compensating for the difficulty of the Throw Check.

Aesthetic Integration: Equipped Artifacts add subtle visual flair to the hero model (e.g., a glowing wristband for a higher ATK stat, a shimmering aura for increased SPD).

3. The Empathy & Purification Loop (Reflector's Core)

This is the central resource economy, managed primarily by the Adaptive Reflector.

Empathy Gauge (Resource): This resource is the literal "flow" and complexity of movement gathered from combat. It is generated by:

Perfect Input: Landing a perfect parry, dodge, or executing a complex combo (rewards dynamic play).

Fusion Attack: Executing a Fusion Attack generates a guaranteed large chunk of Empathy.

The Purification Chamber (Colosseum: Located in the Nexus Colosseum hub. Empathy is spent here to speed up the purification of newly Snagged Shadow Fighters.

Mechanic: A Shadow Fighter is initially Unstable and cannot be used in combat. Spending Empathy fills their Purification Bar. Once full, they are immediately unlocked, receive all banked XP, and learn their full set of four B-Moves.

The Capture Styler (Ranger/Reflector): Empathy can be spent during a Shadow Fighter battle to activate the Capture Styler.

Effect: This temporarily reduces the Shadow Fighter's KF Resistance and briefly interrupts their rigid attack pattern, increasing the chance of a successful Snag/KO Launch.

4. Utility and Progression (MUA Puzzle Element)

World progression is sometimes gated by requiring a specific Utility B-Move from a Snagged ally.

Utility Categories:

Force: Requires high ATK (e.g., Bowser's Smash to break a reinforced wall).

Tech: Requires S-ATK or specific item usage (e.g., Samus's Charge Shot to activate a static energy node).

Flow: Requires high SPD or advanced aerial movement (e.g., Sonic's Boost Spin to bypass a rapidly closing gate).

Saga Gating: Missions in Sector Gamma: The Dimensional Anchor (Book 4-6) rely heavily on the 4-hero team having the right combination of Force, Tech, and Flow to solve environmental puzzles and advance the story.

This provides the full framework. You've got the cinematic action, the strategic team management, and the satisfying grind.

What part of this needs to hit harder, Reflector? Maybe we design that Mario/Sonic Fusion Attack now, using this Progression System framework?
