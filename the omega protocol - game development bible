PROJECT OMEGA: THE GRAND UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE
1. THE VISION: EVOLUTIONARY SUPERIORITY
We are not recreating the past; we are expanding upon it. This game represents the transition from the "Legends of Old" to the "Next Generation" (The Kids) as detailed in the 9-book saga.
• The Goal: To create a "Superiority-Tier" experience that makes all previous fighting and action-adventure games feel like tech demos.
• The Stakes: High-octane, world-ending threats centered around an original, terrifying antagonist that challenges the very concept of heroism.
2. KINETIC DESIGN (SMASH-STYLE MECHANICS)
Every developer and agent must adhere to these frame-data and "feelability" standards:
• Frame-Perfect Input: Zero-latency response. If a player thinks it, the character does it.
• The Weight of Legend: Characters have distinct "Weight Classes." Heavy hitters should feel like they are tearing the earth; speedsters should move so fast they leave "After-Image Shadows."
• Transformations: Evolution is a core mechanic. Transformations must be mid-combat, instant, and alter the character's entire moveset, frame-data, and gravity curve in real-time.
• Combat Crunch: Use "Dynamic Hit-Stop." When a "Legendary Blow" lands, the game freezes for exactly 0.08 seconds, the screen desaturates, and a shockwave ripples through the environment.
3. NARRATIVE SYNERGY (THE 9-BOOK SAGA)
The game is the book. The book is the game.
• Lore Consistency: Every line of code must respect the 9-book history. The AI must treat the books as "The Source of Truth."
• Environmental Storytelling: Stages are not just backgrounds. They are evolving set-pieces that reflect the specific moments and "Fan-Favorite" locations from the books.
• Legacy-to-New-Gen: The game must support a "Generational Mechanic" where the "Legends" pass down traits, moves, or "Essence" to the "Kids" during the progression of the story.
4. VISUAL & CREATIVE IDENTITY (ANTI-COPYRIGHT GUARDRAILS)
We "Reflect and Adapt." We take the essence and make it better.
• Aesthetic Pivot: If a move is inspired by a legend (e.g., a blue blur), we evolve it into "Fractal Light Speed" or "Dimensional Tearing."
• Originality Filter: No character design can share more than 15% visual similarity with existing IPs. Use "Hyper-Modern" materials—iridescent energy, living metal, and spiritual auras.
• The Bronx Grit: The visual style must feel "Real." Not cartoonish. Think "Cinematic Realism" with a high-contrast, saturated palette that feels like a life-or-death struggle.
5. TECHNICAL & CODING MANDATE
For all programming agents:
• Modularity: All scripts (Movement, Combat, AI) must be decoupled. Use "Component-Based Architecture."
• Global State Management: Ensure transformations and power-ups are handled via a robust "State Machine" to prevent animation glitches.
• AI Intelligence: NPCs must utilize "Anticipatory Logic." They shouldn't react to what the player did; they should calculate what the player is about to do based on input patterns.
6. THE "FEEL" TEST
If it doesn't feel like a "Masterpiece" in the first 30 seconds of play, it is a failure.
• Movement: Snappy, fluid, adaptive.
• Impact: Brutal, weighted, satisfying.
• Soul: It must feel like the Bronx—unyielding, powerful, and authentic.
