TECHNICAL DESIGN DOC: THE RESONANT PROTAGONIST (THE NEXT GEN)
1. THE ESSENCE: THE ADAPTIVE SPARK
This character represents the "Future no one has seen." They are light, agile, and carry the "Essence" of the 9-book saga. Their movement isn't just fast—it's "Pre-Cognitive." They feel like they are moving before the player even fully tilts the stick.
• Personality: Bronx resilience meets high-tech evolution. Focused, empathetic, but dangerously sharp.
• Visual Signature: "Hard-Light Echoes." Every move leaves a trail of translucent light that briefly mimics the silhouette of the "Legends" who taught them.
2. MECHANICAL ARCHETYPE: "THE KINETIC REFLECTOR"
• Weight Class: Featherweight (Weight Value: 75 - Light but hard to catch).
• Movement Speed: Elite. The highest "Initial Dash" speed in the game.
• Air Mobility: Triple Jump capability. Implement "Momentum Preservation"—if they are hit but tech correctly, they keep their speed.
• Passive Ability: "Empathetic Resonance" - As the Hero takes damage or lands hits, a "Resonance Meter" fills. At 100%, they enter a "Shapeshift State" where their frame data temporarily matches the opponent's best moves, but with a 10% speed buff.
3. SIGNATURE COMBAT MECHANICS (THE "FEEL")
• The "Flicker-Strike" (Neutral Special):
• Startup: 3 frames (Lightning fast).
• Active: 3 frames.
• Logic: A multi-hit jab that pulls the opponent closer. It’s designed to set up high-skill "Combo-Extensions."
• The "Legacy Dash" (Side Special):
• Mechanic: A horizontal burst. If timed perfectly against a projectile, the Hero "Absorbs" the energy and fires it back as a counter-burst.
• Anti-Copyright Rule: No "Spin Dash." Use "Quantum Tunneling"—the character turns into a streak of raw data/light and reappears on the other side of the enemy.
• The "Sky-Anchor" (Up Special/Recovery):
• Visual: They throw a "Spectral Chain" (from your lore) that hooks onto the stage or an enemy.
• Feel: High tension. The pull-back should feel snappy, using a "Bungee Physics" script.
4. THE "REACTIVE" UI & AUDIO
• Sound Design: High-frequency "zips" and "shimmers." Their footsteps shouldn't thud; they should "clink" like metal on glass.
• Dynamic Camera: When the Hero reaches top speed, the camera FOV pulls back and adds a "Motion Blur" effect to the edges of the screen to simulate G-force.
5. CODE DIRECTIVE: THE "MIRROR" SCRIPT
For the programming agents to handle the "Reflector" nature:
