## WORLD RULES (30-SECOND VERSION)

**The Weave:** Reality's fabric. Tears create Rifts that spawn Void creatures.

**Memory Magic:** Past experiences = power. Can replay battles, channel fallen heroes.

**Fusion Mechanic:** 100% synergy meter required. 30-second timer. Real-time stat/moveset changes.

**Transformation Tiers:** Base → Powered Up → Ascendant → Hyper → Legendary

**Cost System:** Memory dives weaken present. Time changes create paradoxes. Overuse = identity fracture.

---

## CANON LOCKS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. Kaison + Jaxon = Kai-Jax (three tails: gold/blue/white)
2. The Weave is reality; Voidonus wants to sever it
3. Memory is power (can be weaponized)
4. Voidonus was once a guardian (fallen to nihilism)
5. All High is neutral judge, not evil
6. Grand Star Wish has two endings (fade or endure)
7. 30-second fusion timer (extendable)
8. Kaison's wound = survivor's guilt
9. Jaxon's wound = isolation
10. Cross Point Arena = public Void reveal (Ch 3)

## CHARACTER VOICES (ONE-LINER EACH)

- **Kaison:** Protective, formal under stress. "I won't let anyone else fall."
- **Jaxon:** Impulsive, hides hurt with bravado. "Can't catch me if you're too slow!"
- **Kai-Jax:** Merged consciousness, poetic. "We remember... I remember. I choose this."
- **Silver:** Analytical, cryptic. "I've seen this timeline. Trust me."
- **Lunara:** Empathetic metaphors. "The threads are fraying. We must weave them stronger."
- **Radiant Jumper:** Humble hero, dry humor. "Just doing what anyone would do. Right?"
- **Voidonus:** Layered echoes, nihilistic. "Why fight? Oblivion is mercy."
