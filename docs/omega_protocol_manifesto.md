## 1. THE VISION: EVOLUTIONARY SUPERIORITY

The transition from "Legends of Old" to "Next Generation" marks the birth of the Beast-Kin Sovereignty. We are not iterating on existing frameworks—we are creating a new ontology.

### Core Pillars:
- **Kinetic Perfection:** Frame-perfect inputs, weight class mechanics, hit-stop physics (0.08s standard)
- **Narrative Synergy:** 9-book source of truth with Legacy-to-New-Gen handoff
- **Visual Identity:** Bronx Grit aesthetic (0.8 opacity asphalt overlay, high-contrast lighting)
- **Mechanical Integrity:** Every move teaches, every frame counts, every pixel breathes

## 2. KINETIC PHILOSOPHY

The Aeterna Engine operates on a precise mathematical framework:

$$K = (P \times W) + D$$

Where:
- **K** = Knockback distance (pixels/frame)
- **P** = Power (attack force in damage units)
- **W** = Weight multiplier (inverse relationship: heavier = less knockback dealt, more received)
- **D** = Directional modifier (angle offset in degrees)

### Physics Constants:
- **Gravity:** 9.8 pixels/frame²
- **Coyote Time:** 4 frames (forgiveness window)
- **Input Buffer:** 6 frames (reaction time threshold)
- **Hit-Stop:** 0.08 seconds (visual impact delay)
- **Frame Data:** 1000Hz polling standard

## 4. THE BRONX GRIT: VISUAL LANGUAGE

Every visual element serves the story.

### Aesthetic Rules:
- **Base Filter:** Asphalt-dark with 0.8 opacity (creates dirt-and-concrete ambiance)
- **Lighting:** Practical overhead (streetlights, neon) + cinematic backlighting
- **Color Palette:**
  - Cyan-500: Resonance/Hope (active states)
  - Red-600: Dread/Danger (threat states)
  - White-50: Clarity/Moment (dialogue, victory)
  - Neutral-900: Absence/Void (background, neutral)
- **Typography:** Mono-spaced, ALL-CAPS for alerts, sentence case for narrative
- **VFX Standard:** PBR materials, Subsurface Scattering for flesh, Aura-Lighting for special moves

## 5. COMBAT ARCHITECTURE: STATE MACHINE

```
IDLE
  ↓ (input: ATTACK)
STARTUP (0-3 frames)
  ↓ (auto-advance)
ACTIVE (3-8 frames, hitbox active)
  ↓ (cancel point: JUMP input)
RECOVERY (8-15 frames, ending lag)
  ↓ (auto-advance)
IDLE (return to neutral)
```

**Special States:**
- **HITSTUN:** Opponent knockback + freeze (0.08s)
- **TRANSFORMATION:** Legacy Form activation (1.2x speed multiplier)
- **VOID_POISE:** Damage immunity for frames 0-5 (villain passive)
- **SHAPESHIFT:** Memory Echo triggered at 100% resonance

---

## 6. THE SOVEREIGNTY GAUNTLET: PROGRESSION

Players ascend through the Gauntlet by:
1. **Earning Resonance:** Successful combos, reads, and frame-perfect executions
2. **Managing Dread:** Narrative consequences, enemy aggression, environmental hazards
3. **Unlocking Transforms:** Character-specific metamorphosis at story beats
4. **Collecting Relics:** Resonance Relics grant passive bonuses (damage, speed, range)

---

## 7. BUILD PHILOSOPHY

This is not a "game with features." This is a **combat meditation.**

Every system serves the core feel:
- Is it precise? (Kinetic precision)
- Is it fair? (Input clarity)
- Does it teach? (Mechanical progression)
- Does it resonate? (Narrative weight)

## 8. LEGAL & CREATIVE ARMOR

Project Omega operates in The Aeterna—an original IP universe with zero overlap to existing franchises. Character aesthetics, mechanics, narrative arcs, and lore are wholly original creations anchored in Beast-Kin mythology and urban-fantasy storytelling.

**No clone mechanics. No refraction. Only Sovereignty.**
