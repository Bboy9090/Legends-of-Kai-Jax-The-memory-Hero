## ENFORCEMENT RULES

**Zero Tolerance for Legacy Language:**
- Code comments mentioning Smash Bros, Nintendo franchises, or tournament archetypes must be expunged
- Any remaining "clone" or "refraction" references are deleted
- UI strings hardcoded with Beast-Kin terminology only
- Narrative scripts speak only in Aeterna dialect

**The Father's Narrative:**
- Boryn (The Bloodward) serves as narrator/anchor for player agency
- His inner voice is the "Kurama" equivalent—wisdom + strength
- All story beats flow through his sacrifice and resurrection

## DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL

This Atlas becomes the Rosetta Stone for all future development:
1. Share with all AI agents working on the project
2. Cross-reference in every commit message
3. Use as lint standard in code review
4. Reference in design documentation

**The Aeterna is not a remix. It is a resurrection.**
