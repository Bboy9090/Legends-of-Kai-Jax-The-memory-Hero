## 4. MECHANICAL MANDATE (THE ENGINE)

### Core-Resonance Flow System

**Do NOT use "B-Moves" or "A-Attacks."** Use **Core-Resonance Flows** instead.

| Input Type | Beast-Kin Name | Execution |
|---|---|---|
| Neutral Special | **Core Pulse (Neutral)** | Special button (no direction) |
| Side Special | **Core Slash (Directional)** | Special button + left/right |
| Up Special | **Core Ascent (Recovery)** | Special button + up |
| Down Special | **Core Anchor (Counter)** | Special button + down |
| Basic Attack | **Flicker-Strike** | Attack button (rapid tap) |
| Tilt Attack | **Resonance Tap** | Attack button + slight tilt |
| Smash Attack | **Impact Surge** | Attack button + full tilt + charge |
| Aerial Attack | **Sky-Strike** | Attack button (airborne) |
| Grab | **Void-Clench** | Grab button |

### Physics Constants

$$g = 9.8 \text{ (Standard Gravity for all characters)}$$

$$g = 18.0 \text{ (Architect-Tier Super-Heavy exception)}$$

**Knockback Formula:**

$$K = (P \times W) + D$$

Where:
- $K$ = Knockback distance (pixels/frame)
- $P$ = Power (attack damage units)
- $W$ = Weight multiplier (inverse: heavier = less knockback)
- $D$ = Directional modifier (angle offset in degrees)

### Hit-Stop (Combat Crunch)

**Mandatory 0.08s freeze on Legendary impacts.**

- **Implementation:** 5 frames at 60 FPS
- **Trigger Condition:** Any attack dealing ≥10 damage
- **Visual Effect:** Screen flash + particle burst
- **Audio Cue:** Deep bass thud + metallic ring

**Special Hit-Stop Events:**
- **Boryn's Heartbeat Flatline:** 60-frame hit-stop (1 full second)
- **Legacy Convergence Activation:** 12-frame hit-stop (0.2s)
- **Architect Final Hit:** 30-frame hit-stop (0.5s)

### The Bronx Grit Filter

**Apply 0.8 opacity "Bronx Asphalt" texture to ALL UI and 3D meshes.**

#### Implementation Rules:
1. **No clean gradients** — All backgrounds must have grain/noise
2. **Practical lighting only** — Streetlights, neon, overhead harsh lighting
3. **High-contrast rendering** — Blacks are deep, whites are blown-out
4. **Texture overlay** — Asphalt-dark pattern at 0.8 opacity on all UI elements
5. **Color grading** — Slight red push on shadows, cyan push on highlights

#### Forbidden Aesthetics:
- ❌ Smooth Photoshop gradients
- ❌ Clean UI borders without texture
- ❌ Pristine character models (all must have wear/scars/dirt)
- ❌ Lens flares or "game-y" VFX

2. ✅ **Reference this Atlas** as the source of truth for all naming conventions
3. ✅ **Validate character names** against Section 2 (Flagship Translation Map)
4. ✅ **Apply Bronx Grit Filter** to all UI mockups and 3D renders
5. ✅ **Use Core-Resonance Flow** terminology for all move inputs
6. ✅ **Never mention Smash Bros, Nintendo, or legacy franchises** in ANY documentation

### Code Review Checklist

Before committing code, verify:

- [ ] No "Smash" or "Tournament" references (use "Gauntlet")
- [ ] No "Final Smash" references (use "Legacy Convergence")
- [ ] No "Stock" references (use "Resonance Anchors")
- [ ] No character names from legacy franchises (use Beast-Kin names)
- [ ] All UI elements have Bronx Grit Filter applied
