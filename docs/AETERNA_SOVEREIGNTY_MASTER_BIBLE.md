## III. THE BLOODWARD PROTOCOL (ORIGIN BEATS)

### THE STAND: Boryn's Sacrifice

**Location:** The Narrow Pass (Mountain Archway during Genesis)

**Context:** 
- Boryn (The Bloodward) is escorting his sons to safety during a Gauntlet collapse
- Young Jaxon (Speed) is caught mid-fall, panicked
- Young Kaison (Shield) is holding the mountain archway, muscles tearing

**The Choice:**
Boryn turns back. He saves Jaxon first (teaching speed without wisdom = death). Then he anchors Kaison before the archway fully collapses. The weight crushes his chest—his heart stops.

**The Mechanic:**
In Story Mode, this moment triggers a **60-Frame Hit-Stop** (full screen freeze for 1 second at 60 FPS). The screen glitches. The brothers' forms dissolve into liquid light. Boryn's heartbeat flatlines.

**The Birth:**
From the convergence of grief, will, and memory—Kai-Jax manifests. Three Memory Strand Tails (representing each: Boryn, Kaison, Jaxon) spiral into existence. His first breath is their final exhale.

### PLAYABLE ORIGIN SEQUENCE

**Book 1, Chapter 1-3: Young Kaison Solo**
- **Objective:** Teach Weight Class mechanics and Shield-Bash reflect
- **Mission:** "Bulwark" (hold position under pressure)
- **Climax:** Kaison holds the archway—player must time shield-bash to reflect falling debris
- **Outcome:** Kaison sacrifices mobility for protection (weight = power + vulnerability)

**Book 2, Chapter 1-3: Young Jaxon Solo**
- **Objective:** Teach Speed mechanics and Risk/Reward
- **Mission:** "Blink-Strike" (high-execution escape sequence)
- **Climax:** Jaxon attempts to outrun a collapsing bridge—player must time dashes perfectly
- **Outcome:** Jaxon learns speed without purpose = reckless death

**Book 3, Chapter 1: Kai-Jax Awakening**
- **Objective:** Introduce Memory Echo Shapeshift
- **Mechanic:** Player can toggle between Kaison's defense and Jaxon's offense in real-time
- **Climax:** First use of Resonance Convergence to defeat "The Guardian" boss
- **Outcome:** Kai-Jax embodies the fusion—he IS the brothers' will made manifest

## IV. TECHNICAL MANDATE

### Physics Constants

$$g = 9.8 \text{ (Standard Gravity for all characters)}$$

$$g = 18.0 \text{ (Architect of Omega—Super-Heavy exception)}$$

**Knockback Formula:**

$$K = (P \times W) + D$$

Where:
- $K$ = Knockback distance (pixels/frame)
- $P$ = Power (attack damage units)
- $W$ = Weight multiplier (inverse: heavier = less knockback dealt)
- $D$ = Directional modifier (angle offset in degrees)

### Impact Physics

- **Hit-Stop Duration:** 0.08 seconds (5 frames at 60 FPS) on all Heavy impacts
- **FOV Shifts:** 70° → 55° on successful grabs (creates claustrophobic pressure)
- **Screen Shake:** 1-5 pixel magnitude based on knockback distance
- **Dread Escalation:** +0.3% per second (low dread), +0.8% per second (high dread)

### The Bronx Filter (Aesthetic Standard)

**Rule:** Every UI element and texture must pass the "Bronx Filter"—no clean gradients allowed.

**Implementation:**
- **Base Layer:** 0.8 opacity asphalt-dark overlay on all backgrounds
- **Texture Requirement:** All surfaces have grain/noise/imperfection
- **Color Grading:** High-contrast lighting—practical overhead (streetlights, neon)
- **Typography:** Mono-spaced, ALL-CAPS for alerts, sentence case for narrative
- **VFX Standard:** PBR materials, Subsurface Scattering for flesh, Aura-Lighting

**Anti-Patterns (Forbidden):**
- ❌ Smooth Photoshop gradients
- ❌ Clean UI borders without texture
- ❌ Pristine character models (all must have wear/scars)
- ❌ Pure black backgrounds (must be textured neutral-900)

---

## V. COMBAT PHILOSOPHY: THE KINETIC ENGINE

### Frame-Perfect Precision

- **Input Polling:** 1000Hz (1ms response time)
- **Input Buffer:** 6 frames (allows combo execution with human reaction time)
- **Coyote Time:** 4 frames (forgiveness window for jump input)
- **Cancel Points:** Every move has an explicit cancel frame (player agency)

### State Machine Flow

```
IDLE → STARTUP → ACTIVE → RECOVERY → IDLE
      ↑                              ↓
      ← ← ← ← ← CANCEL POINT ← ← ← ←
```

**Special States:**
- **HITSTUN:** Knockback + 0.08s freeze
- **TRANSFORMATION:** Legacy Shift activation (1.2x speed multiplier)
- **VOID_POISE:** Damage immunity frames 0-5 (villain passive)
- **SHAPESHIFT:** Memory Echo at 100% resonance

### Weight Class Philosophy

| Class | Range | Example | Knockback Modifier | Speed Modifier |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Very Light | 50-65 | Umbra-Flux | 1.4× received | 1.3× movement |
| Light | 66-75 | Lunara Solis | 1.2× received | 1.15× movement |
| Medium | 76-90 | Kai-Jax, Sentinel Vox | 1.0× received | 1.0× movement |
| Medium-Heavy | 91-120 | Chronos Sere | 0.85× received | 0.9× movement |
| Super-Heavy | 121-140 | Boryx Zenith | 0.6× received | 0.7× movement |
| Ultra-Heavy | 141+ | Architect (Villain) | 0.4× received | 0.6× movement |

---

## VI. DREAD METER: NARRATIVE PRESSURE SYSTEM

### The Third Strand (Emotional Resonance)

The Dread Meter is not a "difficulty slider"—it's the **emotional pulse of the narrative**.

**Functionality:**
- Rises naturally during combat (+0.3-0.8% per second)
- Spikes on player mistakes (+2% per hit taken)
- Decays slowly during victory (+0.5% per second after combat ends)
- **Never resets to zero** (carries narrative weight between fights)

### Dread-Based Dialogue Triggers

| Dread % | Tone | Dialogue Style | Example |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|
| 0-20% | Calm | Full sentences, confident | "We move forward. Together." |
| 21-40% | Unease | Shorter phrases, cautious | "Something stirs... distant." |
| 41-60% | Pressure | Fragmented, breathing | "It approaches... can you feel it?" |
| 61-80% | Breathless | Gasps, pauses | "The Architect... calls... us..." |
| 81-100% | Collapse | Whispers, inevitability | "...no escape... only... forward..." |

### High Dread VFX Stack

At **80%+ Dread**, the following visual effects trigger:

1. **Radial Vignette:** Darkness creeps from screen edges (opacity: 0.3 + dread/300)
2. **Chromatic Aberration:** Red/cyan fringing on all edges (2-3px offset)
3. **FOV Compression:** 70° → 55° (tunnel vision effect)
4. **Color Grading Shift:** Red +30%, Green -15%, Blue -15%
5. **Screen Shake:** 1-5px magnitude on every hit
6. **Audio Distortion:** Pitch warping (+/- 0.1× base frequency)

---

## VII. THE ARCHITECT OF OMEGA (FINAL BOSS)

### Design Philosophy

The Architect is not a person—it's a **force of inevitability**.

**Visual Identity:**
- Obsidian geometry merged with liquid darkness
- Non-Euclidean limbs that bend at impossible angles
- Reality fractures/glitches around its presence
- Ground cracks into void beneath its feet

**Personality:**
- Speaks in certainties, not threats
- Walks through space like a law of physics
- Every move feels inevitable—unblockable without specific tech
- Presence alone raises Dread meter (+2% per second)

### Combat Stats

- **Weight:** 140 (Super-Heavy+)
- **Gravity:** 18.0 (vs standard 9.8)
- **Passive: Unyielding Poise** — Takes zero damage from 0-5% attacks
- **Passive: Inevitable Weight** — Cannot be launched unless cumulative hit damage ≥ 20%

### Signature Moves

1. **Void-Clench** (Grab) — 1.2 screen unit range, Void Stun on connect
2. **Legendary End** (Shockwave) — Full-screen unavoidable unless interrupted
3. **Glitch-Step** (Teleport) — Frame-1 invincible repositioning
4. **Void-Drain** (Projectile) — Drains +2% Resonance per hit
5. **Collapse Event** (Ultimate) — Reality tears, arena shrinks 50%

### Three-Phase Fight

- **Phase 1 (100-66% HP):** Standard moveset, learning phase
- **Phase 2 (66-33% HP):** Collapse Event triggers, Legendary End spam increases
- **Phase 3 (33-0% HP):** Desperate aggression, Glitch-Step becomes reactive

**Designed Counter:** High-dread burst damage window—at 90%+ Dread, all player moves deal +20% damage to Architect.
